# JSONClassGeneratorApiSamples

These are sample projects for the (free) [JSON Class Generator](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/json-class-generator/id1137163774?mt=12) Mac App.

They should show you, how easy it is, to implement APIs using this tool and save you further work, by giving you complete implementations for your favorite APIs - so you can just copy this code into your project.

Each folder contains a fully runnable Xcode project implemented in Objective-C, that contains classes for parsing JSON, that were generated by the [JSON Class Generator](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/json-class-generator/id1137163774?mt=12).

As you might have guessed, the folder names are domain names of the implemented APIs written in reverse, so that you can find your favorite API quickly.

I hope, that this list will grow and that it will become a central place to go to, if someone needs an implementation in Objective-C for some API.

That is why the project has a rather unrestrictive license, so we can join our efforts and everyone can benefit from it.

If your favorite API is not in the (currently rather short) list of implemented APIs, let me know - or even better: create a pull request :D
